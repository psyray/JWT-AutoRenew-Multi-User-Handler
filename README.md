# 🚀 JWT AutoRenew & Multi-User Handler

A Burp Suite extension for seamless JWT renewal and advanced multi-user session handling.

## 📝 Overview

**JWT AutoRenew & Multi-User Handler** is a Burp Suite extension designed to automate the renewal of short-lived JWT access tokens using refresh tokens. It ensures uninterrupted security testing by preventing 401 errors due to token expiration, and provides advanced features for multi-user authorization testing.

This extension is a complete rewrite and consolidation of the original [BurpExtension-JWT-4-session-handling](https://github.com/V9Y1nf0S3C/BurpExtension-JWT-4-session-handling), with a modern, user-friendly interface and enhanced capabilities.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔄 **Automatic JWT Renewal:**  
  Detects expired JWT tokens in outgoing requests.
  Uses the refresh token to obtain a new JWT via a configurable renewal URL.
  Updates the Authorization header in the request with the new token.

- 👥 **Multi-User Support:**  
  Extracts a user identifier (configurable key, e.g., `username`) from the JWT payload.
  Stores JWT and refresh tokens in Burp's cookie jar, using a user-specific path (`/username`).
  Manages multiple tokens for different users in parallel.

- 🛠️ **Session Handling Rules Integration:**  
  Fully compatible with Burp Suite's Session Handling Rules.
  Works with all Burp tools (Scanner, Repeater, Intruder, Proxy, etc.).
  Designed for use with [Auth Analyzer](https://github.com/simioni87/auth_analyzer) for vertical and horizontal authorization testing.

- 🕰️ **Automatic Proxy History Analysis:**  
  On extension startup, analyzes the proxy history to detect and store existing tokens for each user.

- 🍪 **Advanced Cookie Management:**  
  Create, update, delete, and retrieve custom cookies for each user.

- ⚙️ **Highly Configurable:**  
  Customizable JWT and refresh token variable names.
  Custom cookie domain.
  Custom authorization header name (e.g., Bearer ...).
  Custom JWT payload key for user identification.
  Custom token renewal URL.
  Debug mode for detailed logging.

- 🖥️ **User-Friendly GUI:**  
  Dedicated Burp Suite tab with:
    - Configuration fields for all parameters.
    - Real-time log area with autoscroll and line limit.
    - Apply button for configuration changes.
    - Status messages and debug information.

- 🐞 **Advanced Debugging:**  
  Enable debug mode to display detailed logs of all internal operations.
  Error reporting for decoding, renewal, and configuration issues.

- 🌗 **Theme Support:**  
  Automatically adjusts interface and log colors for Burp Suite's dark or light theme.

## 🚦 Usage

1. **Install the extension** in Burp Suite (Extender > Extensions).
2. **Configure the options** in the "JWT AutoRenew & Multi-User Handler" tab:
   - Set the names for the access and refresh tokens, cookie domain, authorization header, user key, and token renewal URL.
   - Enable debug mode for detailed logs if needed.

3. **Define Session Handling Rules** to apply the extension's actions to your desired scope (Scanner, Repeater, Intruder, etc.).
   - Session handling (Main session window)

   - Session handling action (Link session to JWT Auto Renew extension)

   </p>
4. **Start your tests**. The extension will automatically handle token renewal and user session management.

## 💡 Example Use Cases

- 🤖 **Automated Scanning:**  
  Prevents Burp Scanner from failing due to expired tokens by auto-renewing JWTs in the background.

- 🧑‍💻 **Manual Testing:**  
  Seamlessly updates tokens in Repeater, Intruder, and other Burp tools.

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Authorization Testing (with Auth Analyzer):**  
  Combine this extension with [Auth Analyzer](https://github.com/simioni87/auth_analyzer) to test access control for multiple users. For example:
  - Configure several users in Auth Analyzer: one or more authenticated users (with valid JWTs) and one unauthenticated user (no token or an invalid token).
  - Use the extension to manage and renew tokens for each user automatically.
  - As an admin, navigate through the application to collect admin-level tokens. The extension will store these tokens per user in the cookie jar.
  - With Auth Analyzer, replay requests as different users to verify vertical (admin vs. user) and horizontal (user vs. user) authorization controls, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive resources.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **Headless Browser Auto-Login:**  
  Integration with headless browser login (see `jwt_4B_Chrome_Headless_AutoLogin.py` from [forked files](https://github.com/psyray/JWT-AutoRenew-Multi-User-Handler/blob/forked-files/jwt_4B_Chrome_Headless_AutoLogin.py)) is planned for future releases, to automate initial authentication and token retrieval.
